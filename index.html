            Google Sheets has developed a Sheets extension specifically for the IDEMS teams to use with their Global
            Parenting
            Initiative (GPI) ad. The extension has several key features that help the user create and manage their
            templates and
            feeds.
            <br> <br>

            The first feature is called "Initialize," which creates two types of sheets in Google Sheets. The first
            sheet, the
            Sidekick Sheet, is always hidden. The second sheet is the Content List Sheet, where all the values of the
            flow type
            column are taken from the Sidekick Sheet.

            <br> <br>

            The second feature is called "Insert," which allows the user to create three types of sheets: Global Sheet,
            Template
            Sheet, and Database Sheet. The user can select which sheet type they want to create, and a new sheet will be
            created
            automatically.

            <br> <br>

            All the sheet types are created using a custom formatting template that uses data formatting and custom
            formatting, data
            validation, and customer formatting available in Google Sheets. The variables available for each column are
            specified in
            the extension, making it easy for the user to create and manage their templates and feeds.

            <br> <br>

            The GPI Sidekick extension also has a GitHub action feature, which includes a pull request functionality.
            The user can
            push images to the GitHub repository without using GitHub by selecting the folder in their Google Drive and
            syncing it
            with the extension.

            <br> <br>

            Lastly, the Doc feature is used to create a Google Doc for each row available in a sheet. The user can
            initialize a Doc
            for each row and sync it with the Google Sheet to update any changes made in the sheet.

            <br> <br>

            Overall, the GPI Sidekick extension provides a range of useful features to help the IDEMS teams manage their
            templates
            and feeds easily and efficiently.

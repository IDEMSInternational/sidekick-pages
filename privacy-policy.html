            extension
            only accesses the data required for its functioning, and it does not access any data without the user's
            permission.</p>

          </p>

          <h2>Storage of Google User Data:</h2>
          <p>The GPI Sidekick Extension stores Google user data in Google Sheets and Google Drive. All data is stored

          <h2>Privacy Policy Requirements:</h2>

          <h2>Limited Use Requirements</h2>
          <p>This Google App Script extension is designed to assist the Global Parenting Initiative (GPI) team with
            their development
            tasks. Our app follows the Google API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements. For
            more
            information, please refer to the Google API Services User Data Policy link in our app.

            The GPI Sidekick extension has several key features that help users create and manage their sheets and docs
            conveniently. The extension allows users to create different types of sheets using a custom formatting
            template,
            including Global Sheets, Template Sheets, and Database Sheets. It also includes a GitHub action feature,
            allowing users
            to push images to a GitHub repository from their Google Drive without using GitHub.

            In addition, the GPI Sidekick extension has a Doc feature that enables users to create a Google Doc for each
            row
            available in a sheet. Users can initialize a Doc for each row and sync it with the Google Sheet to update
            any changes
            made in the sheet and also vice versa.

            Overall, the GPI Sidekick extension provides a range of useful features to help the GPI team manage their
            templates and
            feeds easily and efficiently.</p>
